**Unit 7: Compressible Flow** <span id="7"></span> 
*In previous units, we have not considered compressibility as
significant; it is generally not significant for liquid flows or for
slow flows of gases.  However for fast gas flows such as in turbines,
past projectiles, over airplane wings, and in some gas processing
applications, compressibility can be a very important factor in
determining characteristics of the flow.  
  
 In this unit will provide an introduction to the properties of
compressible flows so that you may appreciate the simplicity of
incompressible flow and anticipate possible future study or work.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 15 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 7.1: 4 hours

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Derive the conservation equations for compressible flow.
-   Define Mach number.
-   Solve simple engineering problems involving isentropic and
    non-isentropic compressible flows.
