**Unit 2: Fluid Dynamics and Kinematics** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we will take a look at fluids in motion.  In particular,
we will set the stage for later applications by providing fundamental
definitions and tools for flow situations. These tools include
Bernoulli’s equation for the conservation of energy in this unit and
equations for the conservation of mass and momentum.  In later units we
will apply those tools to commons situations such as flow in conduits
and around obstacles.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 17 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 2.1: 5 hours

☐    Subunit 2.2: 3 hours

☐    Subunit 2.3: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 2.4: 1 hour

☐    Subunit 2.5: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.6: 3 hours

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Use the Bernoulli equation to calculate simple flow conditions (e.g.
    flow stagnation).
-   Use Reynold Transport Theorem to derive conservation laws for fluid
    flows.
-   Derive equations from Eulerian and Lagrangian viewpoints.
