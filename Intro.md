You may think at first that the words “fluid” and “mechanics” should not
go together.  However, the ways in which fluids (gases and liquids and a
few other materials) respond to forces, exert forces, and move from one
place to another (their mechanics) are crucially important to many
aspects of our experience and our ability to build tools. Consider, for
example, the following areas in which fluid mechanics play an important,
if not fundamental, role:
-   Meteorology and ocean dynamics (tsunamis, hurricanes, and tornados)
-   Fluid flow within living systems (blood flow, lymph flow, air flow)
-   Hydraulic machinery (jacks, pumps, lifts, steering mechanisms)
-   Chemical processing and piping (pumps, reactors, separators,
    pipelines)
-   Turbomachinery (jet engines, power plants)
-   Aeronautical and ship machinery (airplanes, helicopters, boats and
    ships)

In this course you will first learn about the definition of a fluid and
the properties of a fluid, such as density, compressibility, and
viscosity.  You will then see how these properties influence the way in
which fluids flow in response to pressure and velocity variations.  You
will study this dependence via conservation equations for mass,
momentum, and energy. Use and solution of these equations for many
situations allows the determination of many details of the fluid flow.
This course focuses on applications to two specialized situations: flow
in pipes and flow around submerged objects (wings for example).  In
particular, you will learn to calculate pressure drops in piping systems
and forces around submerged objects when exposed to flow.  The course
concludes with a brief introduction to the complexities of compressible
flow, as opposed to flow in which the fluid density is constant.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Formulate basic equations for fluid engineering problems.
-   Use the Poiseuille equation, Reynolds number correlations, and Moody
    charts for description of laminar and turbulent pipe flows.
-   Use tables, figures, and energy equations to predict pressure drop
    in pipes, across fittings and through pumps and turbines.
-   Perform dimensional analysis and identify important parameters.
-   Calculate pressure distributions, forces on surfaces, and buoyancy.
-   Analyze flow situations and use appropriate methods to obtain
    quantitative information for engineering applications.

### Course Information

Welcome to ME201.  Below, please find general information on this course
and its requirements.   
    
 **Course Designers: **Stephanie Redfern and Tuan Dinh  
    
 **Peer Reviewers:** [Dr. Steve
Gibbs](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-a-g/#DrSteveGibbs)  
    
 **Primary Resources: ** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following free, online resources from academic institutions that are key
to completing this course:  

-   University of Kentucky: Professor J. M. McDonough’s Lectures Notes
    on Introduction to Fluid Mechanics: [“Lectures on Elementary Fluid
    Dynamics”](http://www.engr.uky.edu/~acfd/lecturenotes1.html)
-   University of Iowa: Professor Fred Stern’s [Lecture Notes on Fluid
    Mechanics](http://www.engineering.uiowa.edu/~fluids/)

In addition, please note that there are several video demonstrations of
important fluid mechanics phenomena; these should be an enjoyable and
informative part of the course. It is imerative that you have adequate
computer resources (connection speed and software) to take advantage of
these resources.  
    
 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Unit 1, as this unit lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
latter units. You will also need to complete review exercises at the end
of each unit. Pay special attention to these since they will provide
examples of expectations for the Final Exam.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** You should be able to complete this course in
approximately **120 hours** of study and creative effort.  Each unit
includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount of time you are
expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help you plan your time
accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at these time advisories
and to determine how much time you have over the next few weeks to
complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For example,
Unit 1 should take you 17 hours.  Perhaps you can sit down with your
calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 2 hours) on
Monday night; subunit 1.2 (a total of 3 hours) on Tuesday night; half of
subunit 1.4 (about 2 hours) on Wednesday night; the remainder of subunit
1.4 (about 2 hours) on Thursday night; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions: **Most of the materials for this course are easy to
read or study quickly; it is easy to convince yourself prematurely that
you understand the material. Re-reading may be a useful technique to
help better understand the material.  Most students learn this sort of
material best by implementing example calculations either by hand or by
machine.  In fact, many students really begin to understand the
underlying mathematics only after implementing numerical calculations by
machine.
